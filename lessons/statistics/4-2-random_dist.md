[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> Exercise 4.2 The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be
uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the
same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF.
Is the distribution uniform?

```
sample = np.random.random(1000)
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(sample, label='pmf')
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)

cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(sample)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.config(xlabel='number', ylabel='prob')
```

The distribution is uniform. The PMF doesn't work since it's uniform and it just looks like a square.
